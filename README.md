# This is a first try at a new portfolio with newly found web design knowledge from my first year in college.

This website aims to store all of my projects, personal & professional work, and resumes in one place.

### What was this webpage build on?

I used PHPStorm as my IDE, along with XAMPP to host and view it on my local machine.
The main languages used were PHP, CSS and jQuery. PHP seemed a little redundant
as HTML could achieve my needs, but I wanted to challenge myself to use new languages
to do what I could do with others.

### Where can I view this portfolio?

Currently, there is no means of viewing it as it has not been deployed to a webserver yet, but
that is in the works through AWS. The portfolio is not finished either.
